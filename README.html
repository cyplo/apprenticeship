<p>These are notes for the Apprenticeship Programme.
Distributed under Creative Commons Attribution Sharealike International 4.0</p>
<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>This programme intends to embed the same baseline knowledge into a new person, to avoid discovering holes in their knowledge later.</p>
<p>This programme needs a one-to-one pairing of apprentice with a senior developer. It must be implemented within existing team structure, already working on some project. The reason for such requirements is to present the apprentice with real-life problems. Because of the above it works best with long-term assignements, where you invest in a person and your team dynamics up front to get the work quality you need.</p>
<p>Recommended timeframe for covering the topics below is 3 months, however can be shortened/made longer depending on the progress of the apprentice.</p>
<p>Tested on several mentor-apprentice pairs, always with local pairing. No remote experience here, would probably need adjustment for remote settings.
Have such experience - please contribute !</p>
<p>If you have experience being an apprentice or a mentor - feel free to add a pull request here, however small !</p>
<p>Don't want to create a pull request ? Starting an apprenticeship programme and unsure how it should be run in practice ? World seems bleak and stripped of joy ? Contact me: email/jabber/xmpp: cyplo@cyplo.net</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>for the apprentice to be able to learn on their own</li>
<li>baselining knowledge - this allows other, equally trained, people to expect knowledge of the subjects below when working with the apprentice</li>
<li>for the apprentice to feel comfortable when asking questions</li>
<li>allows the apprentice to formulate a plan of approaching a problem on their own - do not hand over a complete plan of actions</li>
</ul>
<h2>General</h2>
<p>Before apprentice starts:  </p>
<ul>
<li>decide on the mentor</li>
<li>make sure that everyone understands that we're investing the time now to iron out all of the issues today - this means that the whole team is taking a performance hit by accepting the apprentice, and they do want to do it anyway.</li>
<li>make sure to announce when the apprentice starts to everyone involved.</li>
</ul>
<p>Starting</p>
<ul>
<li>look through this document</li>
<li>look through other materials available<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/joebew42/study-path">study paths</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>discuss your experience, come up with a plan for first week <strong>together</strong></li>
<li>after the week come up with the plan for the next week and so on every week</li>
<li>treat this document as a rough sketch of a overarching plan/list of goals</li>
<li>revise the progress on the bigger picture every week</li>
</ul>

<li>Fowler's "Refactoring"</li>
<li>RSS feeds [share people's feeds - see .opml files in the repo]</li>
</ul>
<p>Noting stuff down</p>

</ul>
<p>Learn to learn</p>

</ul>
<h2>Tech</h2>
<p>commandline:</p>
<ul>
<li>bash/zsh [cygwin if Windoze]</li>
<li>pipes, redirects</li>
<li>when in doubt use the simpliest, most brute force tools possible, i.e. grep and find. introduce grep as a tool to check for mistakes during refactorings, etc</li>
<li>involve grep and find for finding places in legacy code</li>
</ul>
<p>SCM</p>
<ul>
<li>share configs, especially diff tool setups</li>
<li>spend some real time explaining basics of centralized vs distributed solutions</li>
